## What is the difference between c and cpp ?
| **Feature**              | **C**                                                          | **C++**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Programming Paradigm** | Procedural (Structured) Programming Language                   | Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOP)                                                      |
| **Main Focus**           | Focuses on functions and procedures                            | Focuses on objects and classes                                                                  |
| **Approach**             | Follows **Top-down** approach (program divided into functions) | Follows **Bottom-up** approach (combine data and functions into objects)                        |
| **OOP Support**          | Does **not** support OOP concepts                              | Supports OOP — **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation**               |
| **Security**             | Less secure — no data hiding                                   | More secure — data can be hidden using **access specifiers** (`private`, `protected`, `public`) |
| **Function Overloading** | Not supported                                                  | Supported                                                                                       |
| **Encapsulation**        | Not supported                                                  | Supported                                                                                       |
| **Inheritance**          | Not supported                                                  | Supported                                                                                       |
| **Polymorphism**         | Not supported                                                  | Supported                                                                                       |

- Not purely oops.
- General-purpose programming language.
- Complied Language.
- Faster than java and python.
- Middle level language.
- Protable/Machine independent but platform dependent.
- Powerful.
- Extensible - we can add user-defined functions.
- Dynamic allocation
- Case Sensitive
- pointers
- Strongly typed Programming language.

## Structure of c++ :
| **Concept**                  | **C (stdio.h)**                        | **C++ (iostream)**                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Function**           | `int scanf(const char *format, ...);`  | `cin >> variable;`                              |
| **Object Used for Input**    | —                                      | `cin` → predefined object of **istream** class  |
| **Operator Used for Input**  | —                                      | `>>` → **Extraction operator**                  |
| **Example 1**                | `scanf("%d", &x);`                     | `cin >> x;`                                     |
| **Example 2**                | `scanf("%d %s %f", &x, &s, &v);`       | `cin >> x >> s >> v;`                           |
| **Output Function**          | `int printf(const char *format, ...);` | `cout << variable;`                             |
| **Object Used for Output**   | —                                      | `cout` → predefined object of **ostream** class |
| **Operator Used for Output** | —                                      | `<<` → **Insertion operator**                   |
| **Example 1**                | `printf("Hello");`                     | `cout << "Hello";`                              |
| **Example 2**                | `printf("%d", x);`                     | `cout << x;`                                    |

## Datatypes :
- datatypes are two types :
- 1.Primary datatype
- 2.Secondary datatype
   - Derived datatype
   - User defined datatype

| **Primary Datatypes** | **Derived Datatypes** | **User-defined Datatypes** |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| char                  | Arrays                | Structures                  |
| int                   | Strings               | Unions                      |
| float                 | Pointers              | enums                       |
| double                |                       | typedef                     |
| wchar_t               |                       | Class                       |
| bool                  |                       |                             |
| string                |                       |                             |


- unicode table -> unisersal code table, which contains the symbols of all the languages which are world wisely certified.

#### wchart_t : 
- wide character is used to represent is used to represent symbols of unicode.
#### What is the size of wchar_t?
- 2 bytes on 16-bit complier.
- 4 bytes on 32-bit or 64-bit complier.
  
- ascii table is also part of unicode table.

#### bool :
- while(true)           while(1)
- bool flag1=true
- bool p=false

#### string :
In C char str[20]="abcd";
- C style strings same as c in cpp.
- strings predefined function will work C style string.
- With Cstyle strings their may be wastage or storage of the memory.
- In c++ we have string datatype :
```c
string s1;
string s2="Viven";
```
- C string predefined function(like strcpy,strcat,strcmp etc) will not work here on c++ style strings
- s1=s2 -> copy
- s1==s2 -> comparison
- s1=s1+s2 -> concatination

## Operators :

| Operator Name | Symbol | Description |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Scope Resolution Operator | `::` | Resolves the scope of the variable |
| Line Feed Operator | `endl` | Supplies the new line |
| new | `new` | Dynamic memory allocation |
| delete | `delete` | Deallocation |
| typeid | `typeid` | Gives the datatype of the variable |

#### new : 
- Syntax : pointer = new datatype(value)
- ex :
```cpp
int *p = new int(123);
char *c = new char ch='D';
struct st *q;
q = new struct st;
```
- new syntax to create the array :
- pointer = new int[size];
```cpp
int *p = new int[5];
double *q = new int[5];
int **input(int **q,int r,int c){
      q = new int *[r];
      for(int i=0;i<r;i++){
          q[i]=new int[c];
          for(int j=0;j<c;j++){
              cout<<"Enter the elements :";
              cin>>q[i][j];
           }
       }
}
```
#### delete :
- syntax : delete pointer
```cpp
int main(){
        int *p;
        p=new int;
        cout<<"Enter the data:"<<endl;
        cin>>*p;
        cout<<*p<<endl;
        delete p;
}
```
- For dellaoction of memory :
```cpp
for(int i=0;i<r;i++){
      delete[] q[i];
}
```

## Reference variable :
- Reference variable is an alias name given to the existing variables or constants.
- Syntax : datatype &refname = existingname;
- Ex :
```cpp
int num=10;
int &ref = num;
cout<<ref; -> 120
cout<<&ref; ->Address
char ch = 'a';
char &c = ch;
```
#### Points to be noted about references :
- 1.References can be created only existing variables and constants,
- Ex :
```cpp
int n = 10;
int &r = n;    //correct

int &z;     //wrong

int a;
int &r=a;     //wrong

```
- 2.Reference must be unintialized at the time of its declaration.
```cpp
int a;   
int &z;
&z=a;    //Invalid
```
- 3.Once a reference is tieup with a valid variable,it cannot be reffered to another variable.
- 4.We can create any no of references to a variable.
- we can create reference to pointer
- syntax : datatype *&ref = pointer;
- 6.we cannot create array of references.
- 7.syntax to create reference to constant
- const datatype &ref = constant;

## Difference between new and malloc :
| new | malloc |
|------|---------|
| `new` is an operator | `malloc` is a predefined function |
| **Syntax:** `new datatype;` | **Syntax:** `malloc(size_t);` |
| `new` returns a specific pointer type | `malloc` returns `void *` |
| `new` throws an exception on failure | `malloc` returns `NULL` on failure |
| `new` can allocate and initialize in a single line | `malloc` cannot allocate and initialize in a single line |
| Memory allocated with `new` cannot be resized with `realloc` | Memory allocated with `malloc` can be resized with `realloc` |
| `new` invokes a constructor | `malloc` does not invoke a constructor |
| `new` can be overloaded | `malloc` cannot be overloaded |
| `delete` invokes a destructor | `free` does not invoke a destructor |

## Functions :
- Function declaration
- Function call
- Function definition
### How do you pass value to a function ?
- In c we have 2 types :
- 1.call by value
- 2.call by reference
- In c++ we have 3 ways :
- call by value
- call by address(which is call by reference in c)
- call by reference (formal arguments reference to actual arguments )
#### call by address :
```c

```
#### call by reference :
- In call by reference ,formal arguments are references of the actual arguments, so formal arguments doesnot consume extra memory they refer to the actual arguments memoty blocks,so,whatever we modify on formal arguments they reflect on actual arguments.
- function call,function definition are same as call by value.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void inc(int &a){
        ++a;
}
int main(){
        int num=10;
        cout<<num<<endl;
        inc(num);
        cout<<num;
}
```
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
struct st{
        int roll;
        char name[20];
        float marks;
        char mobileno[20];
};
void input(struct st &v){
        cout<<"Enter the roll no :";
        cin>>v.roll;
        cout<<"Enter the name : ";
        cin>>v.name;
        cout<<"Enter the marks : ";
        cin>>v.marks;
        cout<<"Enter the mobileno : ";
        cin>>v.mobileno;
}
void print(struct st &v){
        cout<<v.roll<<endl;
        cout<<v.name<<endl;
        cout<<v.marks<<endl;
        cout<<v.mobileno<<endl;
}
int main(){
        struct st var;
        input(var);
        print(var);
}
```
## Return type as reference :
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int & add(int a,int b){
        int c;
        c=a+b;
        return c;
}
int main(){
        int n1=10,n2=20,n3;
        n3=add(n1,n2);
        cout<<"Sum="<<n3<<endl;
}
```
- In above call by reference we returning the reference of local variable, so leads to segmentation fault.
- To make c alive we should declare c as static
### Corrected code :
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int & add(int a,int b){
        static int c;
        c=a+b;
        return c;
}
int main(){
        int n1=10,n2=20,n3;
        n3=add(n1,n2);
        cout<<"Sum="<<n3<<endl;
}
```

- Default arguments to a function will avoid duplication of the codes when no of input arguments are different.
## where to supply the default values to the function ?
In function declaration.
## What should be default values ?
Any thing or any value based on our requirement.
ex:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int add(int,int,int =0,int =0,int =0);
int main(){
        cout<<add(10,20)<<endl;
        cout<<add(5,10,15)<<endl;
        cout<<add(10,20,30,40)<<endl;
}
int add(int a,int b,int c,int d,int e){
        return a+b+c+d+e;
}
```
- To make any argument as default argument ,we have to make sure arguments on the right side of it all should be default arguments.
```cpp
int add(int a,int b,int c){
       return a+b+c;
}
int add(int ,int,int=0);
int add(int ,int =0,int =0);
```

- In this example ,to make 'b' as a default argument 'c' must be default argument.
- simillarly ,to make 'a' as default argument 'b' and 'c' must be a default argument.
- Whybecause mapping of actual arguments to formal arguments are done from left to right.

## Function Overloading :
- Function overloading is a compile time polymorphism which is used to give same name to more than one function with different signatures.
## What is function signature ?
- function signature is formed by
    1.Function name
    2.Type of input arguments
    3.order of input arguments
    4.No of input arguments
  - In function overloading to have different signature  either type of arguments,order of arguments or no of arguments should be different.
- Here we have same name but type of arguments are different :
```cpp
int add(int a,int b){
        return a+b;
}
double add(double a,double b){
        return a+b;
}
```
- Here we have different number of arguments are different :
```cpp
int add(int a,int b,int c){
        return a+b+c;
}
int add(int a,int b){
        return a+b;
}
```
- Here order of arguments are different :
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int add(int a,float b){
        return a+b;
}
float add(float a,int b){
        return a+b;
}
```
- Here this example cannot be overloaded :
```cpp
int add(int a,float b){
        return a+b;
}
float add(int a,float b){
        return a+b;
}
```
- call by value and call by address can be overloaded.
- call by reference and call by address can be overloaded.
- call by reference and call by value cannot be overloaded.

## Storage classes :
- In C we have 4 types of storage classes.
- In C++ we have 5 storage classes.
    1.auto
    2.register
    3.static
    4.extern
    5.mutable -> applicable only to the data memmbers of a class.

## Structures :
### Difference Between C and C++ Structures : 

| **C Structures** | **C++ Structures** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| C structures are a collection of only data members. | C++ structures are a collection of data members and their related functions. |
| C structures do not support any access specifiers. | C++ structures support access specifiers. |

### What is the role of access specifiers ?
- Access specifiers decides who can access them.
- Types of access specifiers
- we have 3 types of access specifiers :
    1.public
    2.private
    3.protected
- private members are accessible only by the members of the structure or class.
- protected members are accessible only by the members and child of the class or structure.
- public members are accessible by members and non members.
- By default members of the structure are public in nature ,so we go with class datatype.

- In C++ encapsulation is implemented using structures and classes.
### What is encapsulation?
- Binding of data and its related functionalites into a single entity is called Encapsulation.

## Class :
- A class is a userdefined datatype , which is combination varaibles and functions.
- Variables inside the class are called as Datamembers
- Functions of a class are called member functions
- Both together are called as members of the class.

### What is a class ?
- A class is a blue of an object.
- A class is a logical representation of an object.

### What is an object ?
- An object is an instant of a class.
- An object is a physical entity of a class.
#### Class and Objects Example

| **Class**   | **Objects**                |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Fruit        | apple, banana, mango, grape |
| Vegetable    | onion, tomato, potato       |
| Flower       | rose, lily, jasmine         |

### Syntax to Create a Class in C++

```cpp
class ClassName
{
    access_specifier:
        // data members
        // member functions
};
```
### Example: Class in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Bank
{
    int accno;
    char name[20];
    float bal;

public:
    void Deposit(float amt)
    {
        // code to deposit amount
        bal += amt;
    }

    void WithDrawal(float amt)
    {
        // code to withdraw amount
        if (bal >= amt)
            bal -= amt;
        else
            cout << "Insufficient Balance" << endl;
    }
};  // <-- Don't forget the semicolon here

int main()
{
    Bank b1; // object creation
    b1.Deposit(5000);
    b1.WithDrawal(2000);
    return 0;
}
```
### Syntax to Create an Object in C++

```cpp
ClassName objectName;
```
- Ex : Bank myAcc;
- The size of an object is equal to the sum of the sizes of all its data members, except when there is padding or alignment added by the compiler for memory efficiency.


- Data Members and members functions inside the member functions belongs to current calling object.
### What is calling object?
- An object which is invoking the member function is called calling object.
```cpp
int main()
{
    Bank myacc;             // (A) myacc is a stack object (automatic storage)
    Bank *ptr;              // pointer variable (uninitialized)
    ptr = &myacc;           // ptr now points to the stack object myacc
    ptr->CreateAcc();       // calling CreateAcc() on the object pointed by ptr (myacc)
    ptr->Menu();            // same as myacc.Menu()

    Bank *q;
    q = new Bank;           // (B) allocate a Bank object on the heap; constructor is called
    q->CreateAcc();         // calling on heap object
    q->Menu();
    delete q;               // destructor called; memory freed

    Bank *r;
    r = (Bank *)malloc(sizeof(Bank)); // (C) allocate raw memory, NO constructor called
    r->CreateAcc();          // **Undefined/unsafe** if CreateAcc expects object properly constructed
    r->Menu();
    free(r);                 // frees memory, but destructor NOT called
}
```

### Array of Objects in C++

An **array of objects** is a collection of objects of the same class, stored in contiguous memory locations.

#### Syntax:
```cpp
ClassName arrayName[size];
```
- Ex : student DB[5];
- DB[0] is an object
- DB[1] is an object
- DB[2] is an object
- DB[3] is an object
- DB[4] is an object

### Syntax to Define Member Function Outside the Class

```cpp
return_type ClassName :: functionName(parameter_list)
{
    // function body
}
```
## Constructors in C++ :

A **constructor** is a special member function used to **initialize an object at the time it is created**.

### Points to note
- The **constructor name is the same as the class name**.
- A constructor **must not** have a return type (not even `void`).
- Constructors are usually declared as `public` so objects can be created from outside the class.
- If you do not provide any constructor, the **compiler supplies a default constructor** (called the *implicit default constructor*).

1. **Default constructor**  
2. **Parameterized constructor**  
3. **Copy constructor**

---

## 1. Default constructor
- A constructor without parameters is called a **default constructor**.
- Note : An unitialized object always invokes or demands default constructor.
- When none of the constructors are supplied by the programmer complier will supply a default constructor for namesake.
- Invoked when you create an object with no arguments:  
```cpp
  Complex e1;     // default constructor called
  Rectangle r1;   // default constructor called
```

## 2.Parameterized constructor 
- A constructor that takes arguments is a parameterized constructor.
- Ex : complex e1(10,30);

## 3. Copy Constructor :
- A constructor whose input arguments or formal arguments is a reference to same class object is calles copy constructor.
- Copy constructors are invoked when we assign an exixting object to a newly created object at the time of itys declarations.
- Ex : complex e1
       complex e2=e1; // e2.complex(e1);
## Complete combined example (Default, Parameterized, Copy) :
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int roll;
    int marks;

public:
    // Default constructor
    Student() {
        roll = 0;
        marks = 0;
        cout << "Default constructor called\n";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    Student(int r, int m) {
        roll = r;
        marks = m;
        cout << "Parameterized constructor called\n";
    }

    // Copy constructor
    Student(const Student &s) {
        roll = s.roll;
        marks = s.marks;
        cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Roll: " << roll << ", Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;            // default constructor
    Student s2(10, 95);    // parameterized constructor
    Student s3 = s2;       // copy constructor

    cout << "\nStudent details:\n";
    s1.show();
    s2.show();
    s3.show();
}
```

## Copy :
C++ needs to copy data members of obj1 into obj2.
This happens using a copy constructor by default.
```cpp
ClassA obj1;
ClassA obj2 = obj1;  // Copy operation
```
- How does the copying behave with pointers or dynamically allocated memory?
1.Shallow copy
2.Deep copy

### Shallow copy :
Shallow copy means:
Copy the address of dynamically allocated memory — NOT the actual data.
So two objects share the same memory location.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    int *ptr;

    Demo(int x) {
        ptr = new int(x); // dynamic memory
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj1(10);
    Demo obj2 = obj1; // shallow copy

    cout << *obj1.ptr << endl; // 10
    cout << *obj2.ptr << endl; // 10

    *obj2.ptr = 20; // modify

    cout << *obj1.ptr << endl; // 20 !!
    cout << *obj2.ptr << endl; // 20
}
```
In shallow copy they copy member to member or field to field instead of copying the data pointed by members or field.
In shallow copy both destination and source objects refer to same dynamically allocated block, so if one object is modifing it reflects on another object.

- Disadvantages :
Since both objects share the same pointer: Changing one affects the other.
Also, when objects destruct: It will try to delete the same memory twice → crash (double free).

### Deep copy :
Deep copy means:
Allocate new memory and copy the content, not the address.
Each object gets its own copy of the data.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    int *ptr;

    Demo(int x) {
        ptr = new int(x);
    }

    // Deep Copy Constructor
    Demo(const Demo &obj) {
        ptr = new int(*obj.ptr); // allocate new memory & copy value
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo obj1(10);
    Demo obj2 = obj1; // deep copy

    *obj2.ptr = 20;

    cout << *obj1.ptr << endl; // 10
    cout << *obj2.ptr << endl; // 20
}
```
- In Deep copy we copy the data pointed by members instead of addresses so that every object will have its individual copy

- Shallow copy is fine if you do not use dynamic memory (pointers).
- Deep copy is required when:
    You use new
    You have dynamically allocated arrays
    You store resources

## Destructor :
Destructor is automatically invoked to destroy the resources allocated by an object.
Destructor is invoked when n objects is about to destroy.
Destructor name is same as class prefix with tilt opeartor.
Ex : if class name is complex :
~complex(){
}

## Friend function :
friend function is a nonmember of the class,but got the permissions to access private and protectd members of the clss like members of the class.

we have 3 types
  - 1.normal functions as a friend
  - 2.member function as a friend
  - 3.Entire class as a friend of another

- How to make functions as a friend to class?
Declare function declarations with friend keyword inside the class.
The friend keyword is written inside class, but the function definition is written outside.

- 1.Normal (global) function as a Friend :
A simple standalone function becomes friend.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
private:
    int x;
public:
    A() { x = 10; }

    friend void display(A obj); // friend declaration
};

void display(A obj) {
    cout << "Value of x = " << obj.x; // private access allowed
}

int main() {
    A obj;
    display(obj);
}
```
display() can access x even though it's private.

- 2.Member function of one class as a Friend of another class :
Suppose Class B has a function show(), and Class A wants to allow it access.
```cpp
class A {
private:
    int x;
public:
    A() { x = 50; }

    friend void B::show(A obj);  // member of B is a friend
};

class B {
public:
    void show(A obj) {
        cout << obj.x;
    }
};
```
Only show() can access private members of A
Other functions of B cannot access A’s private data.

- 3.Friend Class :
We can make entire class B the friend of A.
```cpp
class A {
private:
    int x;
public:
    A() { x = 100; }

    friend class B;   // whole class B becomes friend
};

class B {
public:
    void display(A obj) {
        cout << obj.x; // private access allowed
    }

    void print(A obj) {
        cout << obj.x * 2; // also allowed
    }
};
```
Now all member functions of B can access A’s private data.

| Type                   | Access Scope                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Normal friend function | Only that one function      |
| Member function friend | Only that member function   |
| Friend class           | ALL functions of that class |
